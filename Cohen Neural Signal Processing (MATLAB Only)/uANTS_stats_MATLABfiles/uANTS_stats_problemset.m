%% Did our little mousey get tired of this task? let's find out!
% Compute TF power, and store the single-trial power from the first 50 trials and last 50 trials.
% Then perform a statistical test of power (permutation testing) for early vs. late trials. 
% Use a p-value of .05. Show the results at an uncorrected level, and correcting for 
% multiple comparisons using cluster correction (or extreme-pixel if you don't have the image-processing toolbox). 
% Pick one electrode for this test.
% If you wanted to test the effects in three electrodes (e.g., deep, L4, superficial), 
%     what would be an appropriate p-value?
